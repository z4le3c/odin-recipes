    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Quesadillas are a scrumptious and satisfying Mexican-inspired dish that's beloved for its cheesy, gooey goodness. Imagine tender pieces of cooked chicken, seasoned to perfection, nestled between two large flour tortillas. These tortillas act as a crispy and golden canvas for a generous layer of melted cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese that blankets the chicken.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked chicken, shredded</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced bell peppers</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place one tortilla in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle half of the cheese over the tortilla.</li>
        <li>Spread the shredded chicken, diced bell peppers, onions, and salsa evenly over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Top with the remaining cheese and place the second tortilla on top.</li>
        <li>Cook until the bottom tortilla is golden brown, then flip and cook the other side until it's crispy and the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Slice into wedges and serve with additional salsa if desired.</li>
    </ol>
