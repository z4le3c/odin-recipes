    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Imagine layers of tender lasagna noodles, generously slathered with rich and creamy béchamel sauce, alternating with a savory and flavorful meaty tomato sauce. Each layer is a harmonious blend of textures and tastes, creating a symphony of flavors in every bite.</p>
    <p>The filling can be a delightful combination of ground beef and Italian sausage, browned to perfection and seasoned with aromatic garlic, onions, and a medley of Italian herbs. Add a touch of red wine for depth of flavor, and let it simmer until it's bursting with savory goodness.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Meat Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 pound (225g) Italian sausage (mild or hot, based on your preference)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (6-ounce) can of tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Béchamel Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and white pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Additional Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles (oven-ready or boiled according to package instructions)</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until they become fragrant and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and Italian sausage to the pan. Break them apart with a spoon and cook until browned and no longer pink, breaking them into smaller pieces as they cook.</li>
        <li>Pour in the red wine (if using) and let it simmer for a few minutes until it reduces slightly.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce on low heat for about 30-45 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Stir occasionally.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Béchamel Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and whisk continuously until it forms a smooth paste (roux). Cook for a couple of minutes to eliminate the raw flour taste, but be careful not to let it brown.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook and whisk until the sauce thickens. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season the béchamel sauce with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg (if using). Remove it from the heat once it reaches a creamy consistency.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large, greased baking dish, spread a small amount of meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of meat sauce over the noodles, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the sauces.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering process: noodles, meat sauce, béchamel sauce, and cheese, until you've used up all your ingredients. Finish with a layer of noodles on top.</li>
        <li>Spread the ricotta cheese evenly over the final layer of noodles.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese is golden brown on top.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows it to set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
    </ol>
